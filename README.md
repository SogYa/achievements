Hackathon organized by VTB. I took part in the Web+Mobile track, the topic of which was the creation of a mobile application with the search for optimal bank branches. The implemented mobile application analyzes the bankâ€™s workload using a neural network on the server and offers the user the optimal branches based on his preferences. The application also implements the construction of both walking and automobile routes.

The application design is based on VTB guidelines.

The theme of this hackathon was the creation of a corporate mobile application for converting an employee's physical activity into charity. My team made it to the finals and took 4th place.
At the moment, I am developing and improving this application for personal use.
