# My achievements
This repository will display all my development achievements. I understand active participation in hackathons and scientific conferences in the field of mobile development

## More Tech 5.0
Hackathon organized by VTB. I took part in the Web+Mobile track, the topic of which was the creation of a mobile application with the search for optimal bank branches. The implemented mobile application analyzes the bankâ€™s workload using a neural network on the server and offers the user the optimal branches based on his preferences. The application also implements the construction of both walking and automobile routes.
The application design is based on VTB guidelines

### Results 
In this hackathon, our team reached the semi-finals
